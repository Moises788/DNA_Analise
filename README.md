# DNA_Analysis
## Code information
The code was developed with the objective of performing an analysis on a fictitious DNA molecule, counting the nucleotide pairs in sequence and presenting them in a graph.

## How was it done?
Initially a [file.txt](https://github.com/Moises788/DNA_Analise/blob/main/date/gene.txt) was created which represents the dummy DNA molecule. In this case, the file was generated by the following [code](https://github.com/Moises788/DNA_Analise/blob/main/index/data_create.py).

After that, using native Python data structures, the nucleotide pairs were organized into auxiliary variables. Right after that, using the numpy library and matplotlib, it was possible to present a [graphic](img/Figure_1.png) the concentration of these in the DNA molecule. The presented process is found [in the following code](https://github.com/Moises788/DNA_Analise/blob/main/index/data_analyse.py)
